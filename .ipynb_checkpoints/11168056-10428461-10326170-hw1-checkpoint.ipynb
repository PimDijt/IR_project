An example was given during the lecture with two ranked lists of length 3 being interleaved, and a randomly clicking population of users that resulted in algorithm A winning ⅔ of the time, even though in theory the percentage of wins should be 50% for both algorithms. Can you come up with a situation of two ranked lists of length 3 and a distribution of clicks over them for which Team-draft interleaving is unfair to the better algorithm?\n",

    "Commercial search engines use both offline and online approach in evaluating a new search algorithm: they first use an offline test collection to compare the production algorithm (P) with the new experimental algorithm (E); if E statistically significantly outperforms P with respect to the evaluation measure of their interest, the two algorithms are then compared online through an interleaving experiment.<br>\n",
    "For the purpose of this homework we will assume that the evaluation measures of interest are:<br>\n",

    "a. Precision at rank k,<br>\n",
    "b. Recall at rank k,<br>\n",

    "2. <strike>Probabilistic Interleaving (Hofmann, Whiteson, and de Rijke. \"A probabilistic method for inferring preferences from clicks.\" CIKM 2011.).</strike>\n",
    " \n",
    "In an interleaving experiment the ranked results of P and E (against a user query) are interleaved in a single ranked list which is presented to a user. The user then clicks on the results and the algorithm that receives most of the clicks wins the comparison. The experiment is repeated for a number of times (impressions) and the total wins for P and E are computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Sign/Binomial Test is then run to examine whether the difference in wins between the two algorithms is statistically significant (or due to chance). Alternatively one can calculate the proportion of times the E wins and test whether this proportion, p, is greater than p0=0.5. This is called an 1-sample 1-sided proportion test.\n",

    "One of the key questions however is <b>whether offline evaluation and online evaluation outcomes agree with each other</b>. In this homework you will determine the degree of agreement between offline evaluation measures and interleaving outcomes, by the means of simulations.
